        <p>We are a family run and recently remodeled Portland bar catering to a small but vocal market of annoying midwestern transplants who dig the politics and forests of the PNW, but miss the chill vibes and indisuputably superior craft beers of Great Lakes region. This place is everything: lighting low and slow, booths with privacy curtains, bar stools are also booths. We offer a small rotating selection of hard-to-find craft beers from the Midwest on tap. Our pool table is well-maintained and creepy old pool guys are kicked out when spotted giving unsolicited advice. Our outdoor patio with ping-pong table is covered and heated year-round. We do not and will never offer darts or pinball because they are terrible games.</p>
